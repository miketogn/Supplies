# Supplies

This is my C#.net mvc project for Code Louisville - May 2018.  

The project is a basic template for a website to track and manage supply orders for my company, Opera Glass Networks, for our printing kiosk customers.  

There are no special instructions to run the site.  all dependancies should download when the solution is opened and built with visual studio 2017.  

For future enhancements i would like to build out the location section to include more information, as well as to build a customer section, and to addform enhancements like a date picker, as well as improvements to the overall theme.
