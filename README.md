# Supplies

This is my C#.net mvc project for Code Louisville - May 2018.  

The project is a basic template for a website to track and manage supply orders for my company, Opera Glass Networks, for our printing kiosk customers.  

There are no special instructions to run the site.  all dependancies should download when the solution is opened and built with visual studio 2017.
