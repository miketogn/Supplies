# Supplies

This is my C#.net mvc project for Code Louisville - May 2018.  

The project is a basic template for a website to track and manage supply orders for my company, Opera Glass Networks, for our printing kiosk customers.  

There are no special instructions to run the site.  all dependancies should download when the solution is opened and built with visual studio 2017.  

For future enhancements i would like to expand the scope of the customer and location informmation to function more as a knowledge base for employees.  I would also like to improve the visual compnents with a better theme, add form enhancements like a date picker and some default values to different fields where applicable.
